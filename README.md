# Front-end-project clone instructions

Clone front end Project from git hub     git@github.com:Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git

Pwd  (you should be in your projects folder)

git clone     git@github.com:Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git bloc-chat (this is the name you give to your project)

cd bloc-chat (move into your bloc-chat project folder)
